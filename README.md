# Landmark Detection with Machine Learning
Have you ever looked through your vacation photos and wondered: what is the name of this temple I visited in India? Who created this monument that I saw in California? Landmark Detection can help us detect the names of these places. But how does the detection of landmarks work? In this article, I will introduce you to a machine learning project on landmark detection with Python.

#What is Landmark Detection?
Landmark Detection is a task of detecting popular man-made sculptures, structures, and monuments within an image. We already have a very famous application for such tasks which is popularly known as the Google Landmark Detection, which is used by Google Maps.

Now letâ€™s get started with the task of detecting landmarks within an image. The most challenging task in this project is to find a dataset that includes some images that we can use to train our neural network.
Hopefully, after a lot of research, I came across a dataset provided by Google in the Kaggle competitions.
